"""
Define here the models for your spider and downloader middleware.

=====================================================================================
Spider middleware documentation in:
https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/spider-middleware.html

Spider middlewares are specific hooks that sit between the Engine and the 
Spiders and are able to process spider input (responses) and output (items and requests).

Use a Spider middleware if you need to do the following:
* post-process output of spider callbacks - change/add/remove requests or items;
* post-process start_requests;
* handle spider exceptions;
* call errback instead of callback for some of the requests based on response content.

=====================================================================================
Downloader middleware documentation in: 
https://doc.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/downloader-middleware.html#topics-downloader-middleware

Downloader middlewares are specific hooks that sit between the Engine and the Downloader and 
process requests when they pass from the Engine to the Downloader, and responses that pass from Downloader to the Engine.

Use a Downloader middleware if you need to do one of the following:
* process a request just before it is sent to the Downloader (i.e. right before Scrapy sends the request to the website);
* change received response before passing it to a spider;
* send a new Request instead of passing received response to a spider;
* pass response to a spider without fetching a web page;
* silently drop some requests.
